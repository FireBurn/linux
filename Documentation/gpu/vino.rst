Vino DisplayLink DL3 driver
==========================

Vino is a Rust DRM/KMS driver for DisplayLink DL3 USB display devices. The
initial device profile supports the Dell Universal Dock D6000
(``17e9:6006``).

The driver owns the USB device and implements the dock's initialization,
HDCP 2.2 authentication, encrypted control protocol, downstream monitor
management, mode programming, cursor updates, video compression, and USB
submission in the kernel. It does not use EVDI or a userspace display daemon.

Configuration
=============

The driver is selected by ``CONFIG_DRM_VINO``. It requires Rust, USB, DRM,
MMU support, the Rust DRM shmem helper, and the kernel crypto primitives used
by HDCP 2.2.

``CONFIG_DRM_VINO=m`` builds ``vino.ko``.

Verbose protocol and scanout diagnostics are disabled by default. Pass
``debug=1`` when loading the module to enable them::

    modprobe vino debug=1

Errors, connection changes, and session state remain visible without this
parameter.

The optional ``CONFIG_DRM_VINO_KUNIT_TEST`` setting builds the driver's KUnit
suite. It is intended for development kernels and is disabled by default.

KMS model
=========

The D6000 exposes two independent display heads. Each head has:

* one primary plane using ``DRM_FORMAT_XRGB8888``;
* one cursor plane using ``DRM_FORMAT_ARGB8888``;
* one CRTC, encoder, and connector;
* a downstream EDID channel; and
* a dedicated bulk-OUT video endpoint.

Atomic commits record the latest desired state and wake an ordered,
device-owned control queue. Blocking USB transactions are never issued from
the atomic callback. A transient control failure retains the desired
generation and retries it; a newer atomic state always supersedes an older
retry.

The primary plane supports the four DRM rotations and both reflection axes in
all valid combinations. Rotated and reflected frames are conservatively sent
as full updates. Their independent codec strips are still encoded in parallel;
identity scanout additionally supports damage updates and encoded-strip reuse.

Mode validation
===============

Vino accepts only mode profiles whose dock-specific control words are known.
The detailed timing, rather than resolution alone, must match one of these
profiles:

* 1280x720 at 60 Hz;
* 1920x1080 at 60 or 120 Hz;
* 2560x1440 CVT-RB at 60 or 120 Hz; and
* 3840x2160 CVT-RB at 60 Hz.

The per-head pixel-clock limit is 750 MHz and the dock-wide active-pixel
budget is checked when both CRTCs are enabled. Unsupported timings are
rejected during atomic validation instead of being approximated on the wire.

Framebuffer ownership and damage
================================

The dock cannot scan out a GEM object directly. Vino therefore copies changed
strips from the shmem framebuffer into driver-owned snapshots before the
atomic commit completes. The compositor may reuse its source buffer after
that snapshot without racing the encoder.

Each head retains at most four validated, owned shmem mappings, matching a
typical compositor swapchain. Repeated flips reuse those prepared mappings;
round-robin eviction and DPMS teardown keep pinned memory bounded. This is the
USB-display equivalent of preparing buffers before submission and requires no
driver-specific userspace API.

Encoding and USB submission run asynchronously on per-head workers. Damage is
tracked against the last frame successfully submitted to the dock, not merely
against the previous atomic commit. This preserves changes when commits are
coalesced or a transfer fails. A bounded retransmission debt accounts for the
dock's internal display buffers.

The video path keeps a bounded, persistent USB request ring. The first
presentation after a mode change carries the decoder arm sequence and the
opening frame in one USB request, as required by the receiver.

Control and authentication
==========================

One per-device session owns the HDCP and encrypted-control counters, keys,
nonces, EP02 submissions, and EP84 replies. The control queue serializes
transactions so a KMS update cannot interleave with a heartbeat or monitor
operation.

Initial transport, authentication, and encrypted-control setup is retried after
transient failures. Once authentication has succeeded, a timeout while
discovering one downstream monitor does not discard the live session. That
head remains disconnected until the bounded runtime re-engagement path
obtains a valid EDID.

HDCP message identifiers and HDMI mode matching use the DRM display helpers.
AES, AES-CMAC, SHA-256, HMAC-SHA256, and RSA operations use kernel crypto
interfaces. Session material is stored per device and is not exposed through
a driver-specific userspace API.

Monitor handling
================

EDID reads are tunneled through the dock's encrypted control protocol. An
unsolicited downstream event schedules a fresh presence probe. Removal,
reattachment, and a connector powered down by userspace are tracked separately
so a deliberate power transition is not reported as a physical unplug.

The initial driver does not register a virtual I2C adapter for DDC/CI monitor
controls.

Disconnect
==========

USB I/O is guarded by a revocable I/O window. Disconnect closes that window
before workers and request queues are drained, preventing new transfers from
starting during teardown. The owned DRM registration, timers, work queues,
frame snapshots, and USB queues are then released by their Rust owners.

Testing and validation
======================

With ``CONFIG_DRM_VINO_KUNIT_TEST=y``, the protocol and codec have KUnit
coverage for cryptographic known-answer tests, captured control-message
vectors, mode profiles, decoder-arm framing, codec boundaries, damage
selection, USB record construction, and serial-versus-parallel output for all
rotation and reflection combinations.

A focused compile check is::

    make LLVM=1 rust/kernel.o \
        drivers/gpu/drm/vino/vino.o \
        drivers/gpu/drm/evdi/evdi.o

External-module ``modpost`` also needs a completed kernel build with a
matching ``Module.symvers``.
