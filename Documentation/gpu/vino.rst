Vino DisplayLink DL3 driver
==========================

Vino is a Rust DRM/KMS driver for DisplayLink DL3 USB display devices. Three
hardware families are supported: Ella (DL-3x00 silicon, e.g. the HP 3005pr),
Ridge (DL-6xxx silicon, e.g. the Dell Universal Dock D6000) and Navarro
(DL-7000 silicon, e.g. the DL-7400 quad-display docks). Each family has a
profile carrying the endpoints, strip geometry, connector count, link limits
and pacing of its hardware; the rest of the driver reads those values rather
than branching on the model.

Device identification
=====================

The driver binds to a DisplayLink *function*, not to a list of product IDs: any
device with vendor ``17e9`` exposing an interface of class ``0xff``, subclass
``0``, protocol ``0x03`` (a DL3 display function; ``0x00`` is the older ``udl``
hardware), plus that device's USB DFU interface. This matches what the vendor's
own udev rules key on, and means a dock nobody has tested is offered to the
driver rather than ignored.

Which family a device belongs to is then read from the device itself. Every
DisplayLink dock carries a sixteen-byte vendor descriptor, type ``0x40``, in
its ordinary configuration descriptor, holding the running firmware version and
an eight-character platform name -- ``NavaDock``, ``RidgeDoc`` and so on. It is
read with a standard ``GET_DESCRIPTOR``, needing no session and no crypto, so
identification happens at probe.

A device whose identity names a family the driver cannot drive is declined by
name, so its owner gets a log line and something worth reporting instead of a
driver guessing at an unknown wire format. A device whose identity cannot be
*read* falls back to a small product-ID quirk table, so a transient descriptor
failure does not cost a known dock its displays.

The number of connectors comes from how many of the family's video endpoints
the device actually exposes, bounded by the profile. A dock in a known family
with fewer outputs is therefore driven with the outputs it has.

The driver owns the USB device and implements the dock's initialization,
HDCP 2.2 authentication, encrypted control protocol, downstream monitor
management, mode programming, cursor updates, video compression, and USB
submission in the kernel. It does not use EVDI or a userspace display daemon.

Configuration
=============

The driver is selected by ``CONFIG_DRM_VINO``. It requires Rust, USB, DRM,
MMU support, the Rust DRM shmem helper, and the kernel crypto primitives used
by HDCP 2.2.

``CONFIG_DRM_VINO=m`` builds ``vino.ko``.

Verbose protocol and scanout diagnostics are disabled by default. Pass
``debug=1`` when loading the module to enable them::

    modprobe vino debug=1

Errors, connection changes, and session state remain visible without this
parameter.

The remaining module parameters are for recovery and diagnosis:

``edid_override``
  Bitmask of connectors whose EDID the dock cannot read -- typically a monitor
  behind a DP-to-HDMI converter that mangles DDC -- and which are described by
  DRM's own EDID override instead.

``force_flash``
  Write the packaged dock firmware even when the dock already runs that version
  or newer. See `Firmware updates`_.

``rtc_utc_offset_minutes``
  Local offset from UTC, in minutes east, used when synchronizing a Navarro
  dock's real-time clock.

``trace_crypto``
  Discloses the ephemeral control and video keys of one session so that a
  ``usbmon`` capture can be decrypted. For protocol work only.

The optional ``CONFIG_DRM_VINO_KUNIT_TEST`` setting builds the driver's KUnit
suite. It is intended for development kernels and is disabled by default.

KMS model
=========

A dock exposes independent display connectors: two on the D6000, four on the
DL-7400, where they are multiplexed over two video endpoints. Each has:

* one primary plane using ``DRM_FORMAT_XRGB8888``, and ``DRM_FORMAT_XRGB2101010``
  as well where the dock's link carries ten bits per channel;
* one cursor plane using ``DRM_FORMAT_ARGB8888``;
* one CRTC, encoder, and connector;
* a downstream EDID channel; and
* a bulk-OUT video endpoint, which two connectors may share.

Atomic commits record the latest desired state and wake an ordered,
device-owned control queue. Blocking USB transactions are never issued from
the atomic callback. A transient control failure retains the desired
generation and retries it; a newer atomic state always supersedes an older
retry.

The primary plane supports the four DRM rotations and both reflection axes in
all valid combinations. Rotated and reflected frames are conservatively sent
as full updates. Their independent codec strips are still encoded in parallel;
identity scanout additionally supports damage updates and encoded-strip reuse.

Mode validation
===============

A mode reaches the dock as a timing plus two control words describing its sync
polarity and its CTA video identification code. Those words are taken verbatim
from decrypted vendor captures for the timings a capture covers -- 1920x1080 at
60 and 120 Hz, and 2560x1440 CVT-RB at 60 and 120 Hz -- and derived from the
mode's own sync flags and VIC otherwise, so a monitor's native timing is driven
rather than approximated.

A mode is refused when it exceeds the ceilings its dock's profile names: the
highest pixel clock a single connector may carry, an optional refresh-rate cap
where the vendor driver is known to clamp, and the dock-wide pixel budget. The
budget is shared, so the atomic check enforces the combined rate of the
connectors a commit leaves enabled, while mode validation refuses only a single
mode too large for the whole dock.

Framebuffer ownership and damage
================================

The dock cannot scan out a GEM object directly. Vino therefore copies changed
strips from the shmem framebuffer into driver-owned snapshots before the
atomic commit completes. The compositor may reuse its source buffer after
that snapshot without racing the encoder.

Each head retains at most four validated, owned shmem mappings, matching a
typical compositor swapchain. Repeated flips reuse those prepared mappings;
round-robin eviction and DPMS teardown keep pinned memory bounded. This is the
USB-display equivalent of preparing buffers before submission and requires no
driver-specific userspace API.

Encoding and USB submission run asynchronously on per-head workers. Damage is
tracked against the last frame successfully submitted to the dock, not merely
against the previous atomic commit. This preserves changes when commits are
coalesced or a transfer fails.

A strip whose content changes is charged one transmission for each buffer the
dock rotates through, plus one, and remains selected until that debt is paid.
One presentation reaches exactly one of those buffers, so a strip delivered to
only some of them would leave the panel alternating between old and new
content. A surface with no change and no debt outstanding sends nothing.

The video path keeps a bounded, persistent USB request ring. The first
presentation after a mode change carries the decoder arm sequence and the
opening frame in one USB request, as required by the receiver.

Control and authentication
==========================

One per-device session owns the HDCP and encrypted-control counters, keys,
nonces, EP02 submissions, and EP84 replies. The control queue serializes
transactions so a KMS update cannot interleave with a heartbeat or monitor
operation.

Initial transport, authentication, and encrypted-control setup is retried after
transient failures. Once authentication has succeeded, a timeout while
discovering one downstream monitor does not discard the live session. That
head remains disconnected until the bounded runtime re-engagement path
obtains a valid EDID.

HDCP message identifiers and HDMI mode matching use the DRM display helpers.
AES, AES-CMAC, SHA-256, HMAC-SHA256, and RSA operations use kernel crypto
interfaces. Session material is stored per device and is not exposed through
a driver-specific userspace API.

Colour management
=================

The CRTC advertises ``CTM`` and a 256-entry ``GAMMA_LUT``, and both are applied
in software during encoding. A dock has no colour hardware to program, so a
compositor correcting through those properties -- as GNOME's Night Light and
KDE's Night Colour do -- would otherwise have nowhere to put the correction on
this output while native outputs are corrected normally.

Colour depth and HDR
====================

On a dock whose silicon carries ten bits per channel, each connector also
advertises ``max bpc``, ``Colorspace`` and ``HDR_OUTPUT_METADATA``. The wire
format is one codec parameterised by sample depth rather than two: an HDR
frame differs from an SDR one only in how deep its samples are, in the escape
ceilings the entropy coder is allowed to reach, and in the transfer function
and colorimetry stated in the mode set.

The link's depth is taken from ``max bpc`` together with the PQ transfer
function the compositor attached, not from the committed framebuffer's format:
driving a ten-bit link from an eight-bit surface is ordinary, and a sample is
widened into the deeper link after it is decoded. A ten-bit connector costs the
dock a third more bandwidth per pixel, so the shared budget is priced at the
deepest connector in use, and where a pair of modes does not fit at ten bits
the depth gives way rather than the mode -- a compositor handed ``EINVAL``
disables the output instead of asking for a shallower link.

Firmware updates
================

A dock reports the firmware it is running in a vendor descriptor, and the
vendor's ``*-release.spkg`` packages state the version they carry. If the
kernel firmware loader can supply a package that is newer than what the dock
is running, vino writes it over USB DFU before opening a control session.

Two deliberate paths exist alongside that. ``force_flash=1`` writes the
packaged image even when the dock already runs that version or a newer one,
which is how a dock left in a bad state is recovered. The
``/sys/class/firmware/vino-<dock>/`` upload interface takes an image from
userspace and writes whatever version it is, which is the only way to re-flash
the running version or to go back to an older one. Both refuse an image that is
not a DisplayLink package or is for another dock family: the DFU interface
supports no upload, so the running image cannot be read back and there is
nothing to restore from.

Monitor handling
================

EDID reads are tunneled through the dock's encrypted control protocol. An
unsolicited downstream event schedules a fresh presence probe. Removal,
reattachment, and a connector powered down by userspace are tracked separately
so a deliberate power transition is not reported as a physical unplug.

The initial driver does not register a virtual I2C adapter for DDC/CI monitor
controls.

Disconnect
==========

USB I/O is guarded by a revocable I/O window. Disconnect closes that window
before workers and request queues are drained, preventing new transfers from
starting during teardown. The owned DRM registration, timers, work queues,
frame snapshots, and USB queues are then released by their Rust owners.

Testing and validation
======================

With ``CONFIG_DRM_VINO_KUNIT_TEST=y``, the protocol and codec have KUnit
coverage for cryptographic known-answer tests, captured control-message
vectors, mode profiles, decoder-arm framing, codec boundaries, damage
selection, USB record construction, and serial-versus-parallel output for all
rotation and reflection combinations.

A focused compile check is::

    make LLVM=1 rust/kernel.o drivers/gpu/drm/vino/vino.o

External-module ``modpost`` also needs a completed kernel build with a
matching ``Module.symvers``.
